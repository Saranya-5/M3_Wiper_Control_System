The traditional system however requires drivers constant attention for controlling the wiping speed manually. Vehicle windshield wiper system increases the driving
safety by contributing a clear shot viewing to the driver. Driving a vehicle is complicated in harsh weather condition without using glass wiper system. Controlling the
wiper speed based on the change in weather condition is one of the research area in automotive industries now a day.Windshield wipers are a small part of your car, but
they have a big impact on your driving and overall safety. They remove rain, snow, dirt, pollen, frost and other debris quickly and smoothly at the push of a button. The
windshield wiper motor moves the windshield wiper arms across the windshield. The metal or hard plastic arms drag a thin rubber (or silicone) blade across the windshield 
to clear away water, giving you a better view of the road. Over time, windshield wiper blades crack, tear and lose their flexibility and functionality.
